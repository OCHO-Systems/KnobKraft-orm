To be done before release:

* About box with Licenses
* Installer build
* Run auto tagging again on visible patches (ask if you really want to do that)
* Compare two patches should show both layers, needs coupled scroll bars.
* Autocategorize should not overwrite manually set tags (what about manually deleted tags?). Idea - second tags column for manual decision, must somehow be calculated with auto decision
Would that need an "accept auto categories" function? Nee, besser - bits für "this is a user decision", und die beim autocategorisieren ausmaskieren
* Progress handler during autodetect
* Memory leaks

Future work
* Record notes played (duration) a specific patch
* Allow to sort by playing time
* Allow to change patch names
* Search box for patch name search
* Display bulk import content
* Make regular backups of Database
* Allow for free list of tags? This requires storing the tags properly in the database, I think, and allowing to delete no longer used tags.

* The big generic module with Python scriptability!
