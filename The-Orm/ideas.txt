Small things
* Sanitize tuning name before putting it into the database column (otherwise displays as "BLOB")
* UI - Can't see which synth selected

For the OB-6 branch
+ Implement parameter set of OB-6 for patch diff?

Macro page
* Select which MIDI input/Synth to use
* Display size of master keyboard (or select lower and upper key)
* Turn macros on/off on a global level (and show it on a global level)
* Also allow sequences, not just chords

Librarian
* Allow multi-select of banks to import (with all feature)

Future work
* Follow program change on synth so we know which patch is playing. This seems to be quite hard on the Rev2, as it does not send program change when set to NRPN transmit.
  * Record notes played (duration) a specific patch
  * Allow to sort by playing time
* Better Macro Button support. But how to get feedback? Play a sound/chord?
  * Hide key
  * Fav key
  * Forward key
  * Backward key
  * Import edit buffer
* Allow for free list of tags? This requires storing the tags properly in the database, I think, and allowing to delete no longer used tags.
* Make regular backups of Database
* I could display which categories were set by the user, and which ones were autodetected
* Better patch name display - the Rev2 patch names are too long. Make it two rows anyway (with two layers?)
* Could have patch name autogenerator like LaserMammoth
* Global settings editor for the synth using the JUCE property editor
  * Need to change MIDI channel internally when using the settings editor to change it

Rev2 Features
* Support custom layering by allowing to combine layers to new patches, and by promoting B layers to A layers
* Noteoff on send patch (or send mute patch first?)

Database schema
* Should have foreign key constraint imports.id == patches.sourceID
* Should have unique constraing imports.id (should edit buffer import contain synth name? could be scrambled by MD5?)
* Should have non-null everywhere
* Should think about naming convention
* Should create indexes where needed 

MIDI setup
* Should have a page to turn on/off known synths (also for the UI), and to be able to change the MIDI channel and MIDI interface per synth (in case autodetect screws up)
* Echo test - send a sysex, and see if this comes back (e.g. K3 or MKS80 repeating them). If yes, down prioritize those echos

UI Cleanup
* Could add "patch diff" button to top row, always already reading "Compare with ..name of previous patch.."
* Could move LambdaButtonStrip to the very top (like a toolbar?)
* Synth selector goes below main tabs, as the MIDI log is global to all synths, and some future functions will be as well (Clock routing, master keyboard setup)

Big things
	* The big generic module with Python scriptability!
	* The automatic patch clusterer!
	* Multiple synths in one grid
	* Masterkeyboard control ("Follow the patch")
	* Auto sample patches, calculate previews
