Simple Features
* Store current edit buffer (might be a nice sequence!)
* Allow to change patch names
* Allow to change patch names
* Make regular backups of Database
* I could display which categories were set by the user, and which ones were autodetected

Future work
* Record notes played (duration) a specific patch
* Allow to sort by playing time
* Search box for patch name search
* Allow for free list of tags? This requires storing the tags properly in the database, I think, and allowing to delete no longer used tags.

* Global settings editor for the synth using the JUCE property editor
  * Need to change MIDI channel internally when using the settings editor to change it
  * Need nicer display for Alternate Tunings
  * Maybe it should be a dialog pop up, as it is so small
  * Need "display offset" to show tuning correctly with negative numbers
  * Need to show MIDI Channel with "Omni"

* The big generic module with Python scriptability!

* The automatic patch clusterer!

* Multiple synthesizers
