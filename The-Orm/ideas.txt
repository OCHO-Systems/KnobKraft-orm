Future work
* Follow program change on synth so we know which patch is playing. This seems to be quite hard on the Rev2, as it does not send program change when set to NRPN transmit.
  * Record notes played (duration) a specific patch
  * Allow to sort by playing time
* Better Macro Button support. But how to get feedback? Play a sound/chord?
  * Hide key
  * Fav key
  * Forward key
  * Backward key
  * Import edit buffer
* Search box for patch name search
* Allow for free list of tags? This requires storing the tags properly in the database, I think, and allowing to delete no longer used tags.
* Make regular backups of Database
* I could display which categories were set by the user, and which ones were autodetected
* Allow to change patch names
	* Better patch name display - the Rev2 patch names are too long. Make it two rows anyway (with two layers?)
	* Could have patch name autogenerator like LaserMammoth

Rev2 Features
* Support custom layering by allowing to combine layers to new patches, and by promoting B layers to A layers
* Noteoff on send patch (or send mute patch first?)

Continuation of started features
* Global settings editor for the synth using the JUCE property editor
  * Need to change MIDI channel internally when using the settings editor to change it
  * Need nicer display for Alternate Tunings
  * Maybe it should be a dialog pop up, as it is so small
  * Need "display offset" to show tuning correctly with negative numbers

Database schema
* Should have foreign key constraint imports.id == patches.sourceID
* Should have unique constraing imports.id (should edit buffer import contain synth name? could be scrambled by MD5?)
* Should have non-null everywhere
* Should think about naming convention
* Should create indexes where needed 

UI Cleanup
* Could add burger menu for seldom used functions like about, autodetect, edit autocategories, rerun autodetect 
* Could add "patch diff" button to top row, always already reading "Compare with ..name of previous patch.."
* Resize touch areas - paging buttons could go below grid in the same row as the page numbers, much bigger
* Global Settings -> are actually <Synth name> settings
* Make the row with the filter category bigger
* Synth selector goes below main tabs, as the MIDI log is global to all synths, and some future functions will be as well (Clock routing, master keyboard setup)

Big things
	* The big generic module with Python scriptability!
	* The automatic patch clusterer!
	* Multiple synthesizers
	* Multiple synths in one grid
	* Masterkeyboard control ("Follow the patch")
	* Auto sample patches, calculate previews
