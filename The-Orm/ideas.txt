Simple Features
* Better display that synth is connected or not
* Allow to change patch names
* Make regular backups of Database
* I could display which categories were set by the user, and which ones were autodetected
* Noteoff on send patch (or send mute patch first?)
* Hide/Delete patches

Future work
* Follow program change on synth so we know which patch is playing. This seems to be quite hard on the Rev2, as it does not send program change when set to NRPN transmit.
* Record notes played (duration) a specific patch
* Allow to sort by playing time
* Search box for patch name search
* Allow for free list of tags? This requires storing the tags properly in the database, I think, and allowing to delete no longer used tags.
* Support custom layering by allowing to combine layers to new patches, and by promoting B layers to A layers

Continuation of started features
* Global settings editor for the synth using the JUCE property editor
  * Need to change MIDI channel internally when using the settings editor to change it
  * Need nicer display for Alternate Tunings
  * Maybe it should be a dialog pop up, as it is so small
  * Need "display offset" to show tuning correctly with negative numbers
  * Need to show MIDI Channel with "Omni"

Big things
	* The big generic module with Python scriptability!
	* The automatic patch clusterer!
	* Multiple synthesizers
	* Multiple synths in one grid
	* Masterkeyboard control ("Follow the patch")
	* Auto sample patches, calculate previews
